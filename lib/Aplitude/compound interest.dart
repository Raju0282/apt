  QuestionModel(question: "1. In India, compound interest is typically calculated on which type of time period?",
      options: [
        "Daily",
        "Weekly",
        "Monthly",
        "Annually",
      ],
      correctAnswerIndex: 2,
      Solution: "Compound interest in India is typically calculated on a monthly basis. This means that the interest is compounded each month on the initial principal amount and any previously earned interest."
  ),

  QuestionModel(question: "2. What is the formula for calculating compound interest in India?",
      options: [
        "A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)",
        "A = P(1 + r)^t",
        "A = P + (P * r * t)",
        "A = P * (1 + r)^n",
      ],
      correctAnswerIndex: 0,
      Solution: "The formula for calculating compound interest in India is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the final amount, P is the principal amount, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the number of years."
  ),

  QuestionModel(question: "3. A sum of Rs. 10,000 is invested at an annual interest rate of 8% compounded quarterly. How much will it be worth after 3 years?",

        "Rs. 11,725.60",
      ],
      correctAnswerIndex: 2,
      Solution: "Using the compound interest formula A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where P = 10,000, r = 8% or 0.08, n = 4 (compounded quarterly), and t = 3 years, we calculate A = 10,000 * (1 + 0.08/4)^(4*3) = Rs. 11,580.80."

  QuestionModel(question: "4. The difference between simple interest and compound interest on a sum of money at 10% per annum for 2 years is Rs. 52. What is the principal amount?",
      options: [
        "Rs. 300",
        "Rs. 500",
        "Rs. 1,000",
        "Rs. 2,000",
      ],
      correctAnswerIndex: 2,
      Solution: "To find the principal amount, we can use the formula: Principal = (100 * Difference) / (Rate * Time). In this case, Principal = (100 * 52) / (10 * 2) = Rs. 1,000."

        "12.75%",
        "13%",
      ],
      correctAnswerIndex: 1,
      Solution: "To calculate the EAR, we use the formula: EAR = (1 + (r/n))^n - 1, where r = 12% or 0.12 and n = 2 (semi-annually). EAR = (1 + (0.12/2))^2 - 1 = 0.1236 or 12.36%."

        "16%",
        "20%",
      ],
      correctAnswerIndex: 0,
      Solution: "When an amount doubles in a certain time, it means it has grown by 100%. To find the annual interest rate, we can use the formula: Rate = (100 * (2^(1/t) - 1)), where t = 4 years. Rate = (100 * (2^(1/4) - 1)) = 8%."
